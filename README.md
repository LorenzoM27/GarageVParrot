# GarageVParrot

## The Project

### Context

This is a project for school.

Vincent Parrot, with 15 years of experience in car repair, opened his own garage in Toulouse in 2021.

For 2 years, it has been offering a wide range of services: repair of car bodywork and mechanics as well as their regular maintenance to guarantee their performance and safety. In addition, Garage V. Parrot sells used vehicles in order to increase its turnover.

Vincent Parrot recognizes that he must be visible on the internet if he wants to definitely make a place for himself among the competition. So he contacted the web design agency you belong to for a first quote, which he accepted.

Your mission will then be to create a showcase web application for Garage V. Parrot, highlighting the quality of the services provided by this recent company.
